var str = "Hello, playground"

//  We’ve used lots of strings so far, and it turns out they are structs – they have their own methods and properties we can use to query and manipulate the string.

//  First, let’s create a test string:

let string = "Do or do not, there is no try."
//  You can read the number of characters in a string using its count property:

print(string.count)
//  They have a hasPrefix() method that returns true if the string starts with specific letters:

print(string.hasPrefix("Do"))
//  You can uppercase a string by calling its uppercased() method:

print(string.uppercased())
//  And you can even have Swift sort the letters of the string into an array:

print(string.sorted())
//  Strings have lots more properties and methods – try typing string. to bring up Xcode’s code completion options.
